                        <h2>Organization History</h2>
                        <p>
                            Archers for UNICEF (AU) was officially accredited by De La Salle University in 2017. At the time, only a few universities in the country - such as the University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, and Ateneo de Manila University - had student organizations that worked closely with UNICEF. Seeing this gap within DLSU, then-sophomore Danielle Solancho recognized the need for an organization that could represent both the University's values and UNICEF's mission.
                            <br><br>
                            Driven by her long-standing involvement in student organizations and her passion for service, Danielle actively sought opportunities to volunteer beyond the University. She reached out to various non-profit organizations, including UNICEF, hoping to gain experience and contribute meaningfully. However, these efforts were often met with rejection or no response at all. Rather than discouraging her, these setbacks highlighted the lack of accessible avenues for students who genuinely wanted to serve.
                            <br><br>
                            When the opportunity to establish a new organization in DLSU arose, Danielle took it as a sign to move forward. With careful planning, extensive paperwork, and the support of her family, she began laying the foundation for Archers for UNICEF. After a series of discussions and coordination, UNICEF eventually agreed to partner with DLSU, marking the official beginning of AU. Since then, the organization has grown into a space where students can actively engage in advocacy, give back to marginalized communities, and take part in initiatives that aim to create meaningful and lasting impact.
